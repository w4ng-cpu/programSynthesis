Our first official model:
Uses the staple class and function declaration code
Compiles only statements
Generates one line at a time
Continue successes and removes failures from search space
Finish with returns
Remembers declared variables

Distribution wise:
Initial approach, one node generates first line
Does not consider inbalance of search space caused by newly declared variables
